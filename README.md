# Physical-Simulation-of-Brownian-Motion
This Python code simulates Brownian Motion.
Please, read the conference proceeding.
Collisions can be made invisible by editing the code section.
At the end of the simulation:
i) The Brownian Motion is drawn in .eps file format,
ii) The Data is saved as .txt file.
